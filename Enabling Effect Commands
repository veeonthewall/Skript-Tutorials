What are effect commands?

Effect commands, in Skript, let you execute effects in-game without having to make new code in your .sk files. 
They are helpful for quick debugging or other tiny miscelleanous tasks.

How to enable effect commands:

1. Install Skript (download: https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript)

2. Start your server if you have not.

3. Navigate to the following file path: plugins/Skript/config.sk

4. Locate 'enable-effect-commands: false' and set it to 'enable-effect-commands: true'

5. Locate 'allow ops to use effect commands: false'. Set this value to 'allow ops to use effect commands: true'

6. Save config.sk

7. Go to your game, and type "/skript reload config".

8. To confirm your effect commands are working, try one! Here's an example below.

Open chat and type "!send size of all players", then press enter.

It will return how many people are online. Congratulations!
